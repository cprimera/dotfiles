## Installation

The easiest way to install is using `install.sh` which can be done in a single step.

#### Using wget

```bash
wget https://raw.github.com/cprimera/dotfiles/master/install.sh -O - | sh
```

#### Using curl

```bash
curl https://raw.github.com/cprimera/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh

This will clone the repository and all submodules and will create symlinks as necessary.
